  [ROADMAP]

1.1:
[ ] Add an optional tech unlock
[ ] Add a player setting for showing/hiding the hover info?

TBD:
[ ] Append channel editor/viewer to existing vanilla GUIs (waiting on mod API support)
[ ] Sync channel force relationships to base force on relationship change events instead of periodically (waiting
    on mod API support)



  [KNOWN LIMITATIONS]
  
-   Channel forces do not currently sync diplomacy settings with the base force, so e.g. if another mod sets a
    cease-fire with the base force, the channel forces will not inherit that setting and may be attacked
-   Only channel 0 networks will show up in the Networks GUI. Seems that GUI does not show friendly force networks.
-   Player logistic requests are only handled from channel 0.
