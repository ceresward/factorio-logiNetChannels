[mod-setting-description]
logiNetChannelLimit=Maximum number of logistic network channels per player faction (1-50).  This setting is applied only when a new game is created, changing this setting will not affect an existing game\n\nWARNING: each channel creates a new faction, and there is a hard limit of 60 factions per game!  For example, if there are three player factions, then the channel limit should be set no higher than 19 (19*3 + 3 = 60)
